## Analyzing Telco Customer Churn with Cloud Pak for Data on OpenShift

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using the Cloud Pak for Data platform to Collect Data, Organize Data, Analyze Data, and Infuse AI into our applications. The goals of this workshop are:

* Collect and virtualize data
* Visualize data with Data Refinery
* Create and deploy a machine learning model
* Monitor the model
* Create a Python app to use the model

### About the data set

The data set used for this workshop is originally from Watson Analytics and was used on a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) project, it contains information about customer churn for a Telecommunications company. The data is split into three CSV files and are located in the [data](../data/split) directory of the GitHub repository you will download in the pre-work section.

#### **[billing.csv](../data/split/billing.csv)**

This file has the following attributes:

* Customer ID
* Contract *(Month-to-month, one year, two year)*
* Paperless Billing *(Yes, No)*
* Payment Method *(Bank transfer, Credit card, Electronic check, Mailed check)*
* Monthly Charges *($)*
* Total Charges *($)*
* Churn *(Yes, No)*

#### **[customer-service.csv](../data/split/customer-service.csv)**

* Customer ID
* Gender *(Male, Female)*
* Senior Citizen *(1, 0)*
* Partner *(Yes, No)*
* Dependents *(Yes, No)*
* Tenure *(1-100)*

#### **[products.csv](../data/split/products.csv)**

* Customer ID
* Phone Service *(Yes, No)*
* Multiple Lines *(Yes, No, No phone service)*
* Internet Service *(DSL, Fiber optic, No)*
* Online Security *(Yes, No, No internet service)*
* Online Backup *(Yes, No, No internet service)*
* Device Protection *(Yes, No, No internet service)*
* Tech Support *(Yes, No, No internet service)*
* Streaming TV *(Yes, No, No internet service)*
* Streaming Movies *(Yes, No, No internet service)*
